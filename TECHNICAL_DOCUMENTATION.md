## 1. Project Overview

ZLabs Portal is a full-stack internal management platform build for Zeex Labs that manages the complete talent lifecycle from internship to permanent employment. It provides:

- A **public-facing Careers page** for applicants to submit applications.
- A **role-gated internal portal** for admins, team heads, mentors, and team members to manage operations.
- An **automated email pipeline** for task assignments, feedback, reminders, and credential delivery.
- A **dual task system**: public-token-based tasks for interns and portal-authenticated tasks for permanent employees.

```

### 3.1 Request Flow

1. Browser makes request → Vite Dev Server
2. If path starts with `/api/`, Vite proxies it to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Django authenticates JWT token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Permission class validates the user's role
5. View processes logic and returns JSON response
6. React updates UI

### 3.2 Authentication Flow

```
Login → POST /api/auth/login/ → Returns { access_token, refresh_token, user, role }
         │
         ▼
Tokens stored in localStorage (AuthContext)
         │
         ▼
All requests: Header: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
         │
         ▼
access_token expires in 8 hours → use refresh_token (valid 7 days)
```

## 10. Authentication & Security

### Current Setup

- **JWT Tokens:** Access token (8hrs) + Refresh token (7 days).
- **Role validation** on every protected endpoint via custom `Permission` classes.
- **Email verification** for public task submissions (intern must match registered email).
- **CORS:** Currently open (`CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True`) — **must be restricted in production**.
- **Secret Key:** Read from `.env` file.
- **Debug:** `False` in production via `.env`.

### Passwords

- Intern-to-Employee conversion generates a 10-character password with letters, digits, and `!@#$`.
- Django's built-in password validators enforce strength for manual registrations.

### 11.2 Step-by-Step Deployment

#### Step 1 — Database: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)

```
1. Create an RDS PostgreSQL instance (db.t3.micro for dev, db.t3.medium for prod).
2. Place it in a private subnet (no public access).
3. Create a security group allowing only your backend ECS/EC2 to connect on port 5432.
4. Update settings.py:
```

```python
# requirements.txt — add this:
psycopg2-binary>=2.9

# settings.py
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': env('DB_NAME'),
        'USER': env('DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': env('DB_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': env('DB_HOST'),  # RDS endpoint
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

#### Step 2 — Media Storage: AWS S3

```
1. Create an S3 bucket: zlabs-media-prod
2. Block all public access (use signed URLs).
3. Install: pip install django-storages boto3
```

```python
# settings.py
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'zlabs-media-prod'
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'ap-south-1'  # Mumbai
AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = None
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com/'
```

#### Step 3 — Email: AWS SES

```
1. Verify your domain (zlabs.com) in SES.
2. Move SES out of sandbox for production sending.
3. Create SMTP credentials.
```

```ini
# .env
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=email-smtp.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=<SES-SMTP-USER>
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<SES-SMTP-PASSWORD>
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=ZLabs Portal <noreply@zlabs.com>
```

#### Step 4 — Backend Server: ECS (Fargate) or EC2

**With EC2:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install gunicorn

# Gunicorn command (in production)
gunicorn core.wsgi:application \
    --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
    --workers 3 \
    --timeout 120

# Nginx config (proxy to gunicorn)
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.zlabs.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

    location /media/ {
        # Serve from S3 or local (if local)
        alias /var/www/zlabs/media/;
    }
}
```

#### Step 5 — Frontend: S3 + CloudFront

```bash
# Build React app
cd frontend
npm run build

# Upload to S3
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://zlabs-web-prod/ --delete

# CloudFront distribution:
# - Origin: S3 bucket
# - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
# - Error pages: 404 → /index.html (for React Router)
# - Custom domain: app.zlabs.com
```

#### Step 6 — SSL Certificates: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

```
1. Request a certificate for *.zlabs.com
2. Attach to CloudFront (frontend)
3. Attach to ALB (backend API)
```

#### Step 7 — Secrets: AWS Secrets Manager

```
Store these in Secrets Manager (never hardcode):
- SECRET_KEY
- DB_PASSWORD
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

## 12. Pre-Deployment Checklist & Improvements Required

### 12.1 Critical Security Fixes (MUST DO before going live)

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True` | Restrict to `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ['https://app.zlabs.com']` |
| 2 | `SECRET_KEY` has insecure default | Generate a strong random key and store in Secrets Manager |
| 3 | `DEBUG = True` in dev | Ensure `DEBUG=False` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS=['api.zlabs.com']` in prod `.env` |
| 4 | SQLite in production | Switch to PostgreSQL via RDS |
| 5 | Media files on local disk | Move to S3 with `django-storages` |
| 6 | Email via dev console | Configure AWS SES for real email delivery |
| 7 | JWT tokens in localStorage | Consider `httpOnly` cookies for better XSS protection |
| 8 | No rate limiting on login | Implement `django-ratelimit` on `/api/auth/login/` |
| 9 | CORS middleware ordering | Ensure `CorsMiddleware` is first in `MIDDLEWARE` list |

### 12.2 Performance Improvements

| # | Improvement | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add database caching for analytics | Redis (ElastiCache) + `django-redis` |
| 2 | Background email sending | Celery + SQS (don't block requests with email) |
| 3 | API rate limiting | `djangorestframework-ratelimit` |
| 4 | DB query optimization | Add `select_related`/`prefetch_related` to all list views |
| 5 | Static file compression | WhiteNoise or serve via CloudFront |
| 6 | Pagination on all endpoints | Already partially implemented — ensure all list views add `?page=` |

### 12.3 Feature Improvements (Nice to Have)

| Priority | Feature | Value |
|---|---|---|
| High | Intern portal login page | Interns can login to view their own task history |
| High | Password Reset / "Forgot Password" | Currently missing for all roles |
| High | File type validation on uploads | Only allow PDF/Doc for resumes, PDF/Zip for submissions |
| Medium | Dashboard charts (Recharts/Chart.js) | Visual progress analytics |
| Medium | Notification bell in UI | In-app notification center |
| Medium | Round auto-advancement logic | Currently manual — could auto-advance on all tasks reviewed |
| Low | Dark/Light mode toggle | User preference saved in profile |
| Low | Bulk task import via CSV | For large intern cohorts |

### 12.4 Production Environment Variables (.env)

```ini
# Django
